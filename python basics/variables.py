"""First we are assigning 9 to a, then calling change function, inside of that we are assigning 90 to a and printing a. After the function call we are again printing the value of a. When we are writing a = 90 inside the function, it is actually creating a new variable called a, which is only available inside the function and will be destroyed after the function finished.
